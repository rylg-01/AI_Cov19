Swin Transformer for Length of Stay (LOS) Prediction from COVID-19 CR Images 


This repository contains code for training and evaluating a Swin Transformerâ€“based regression model to predict hospital length of stay (LOS) from chest radiograph images of COVID-19 patients at Stony Brook University Hospital. 
The model integrates medical image preprocessing and stratified cross-validation,to evaluate the predictive power of deep learning in clinical outcome prediction.
